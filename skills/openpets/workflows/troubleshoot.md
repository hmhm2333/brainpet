# Troubleshoot OpenPets

Use this workflow when setup or pet control is not working.

## Fast checklist

1. Is the desktop app installed and running?
2. Does CLI status connect?

```bash
openpets status
```

3. Are pets installed/listed?

```bash
openpets pets
```

4. Did the user restart Claude/OpenCode/MCP client after config changes?
5. Is the correct project path configured?
6. Is the selected pet id installed?
7. Can the machine reach `openpets.dev` and `zip.openpets.dev` for catalog/zip downloads?

## Common fixes

- Launch or relaunch the OpenPets desktop app.
- Re-run the relevant `openpets configure ...` command.
- Restart the agent/client after changing MCP/plugin/hook config.
- Use the catalog API to confirm pet ids: https://openpets.dev/pets/catalog.v3.json

If the CLI is not installed globally, replace `openpets` with `npx -y @open-pets/cli@latest`.

## Bug reports

If normal troubleshooting does not resolve the issue, encourage the user to open an issue at:

https://github.com/alvinunreal/openpets/issues

Ask them to include OS, app version, agent/client, command attempted, and a short description of what happened. Do not ask them to paste secrets or private logs.
