# Development

How to set up, build, run, and release the workspace. This doc is the practical
"how do I work in this repo" companion; testing and production-validity gates get
their own doc, [Testing and validation](/testing-and-validation).

## Layout & toolchain

- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`) over `apps/*` and
  `packages/*`. Package manager pinned to `pnpm@11.x`; Node `>=20`.
- **ESM + TypeScript everywhere**: every package is `"type": "module"` with dual
  type exports; internal links use `workspace:*`.
- **`web/` uses Bun + Nuxt** and is a separate toolchain - its commands run from
  `web/` with `bun`, not pnpm. Only its data/catalog side is in scope here (see
  [Catalogs](/catalog)).
- **Versioning**: packages align around SDK v3 / `manifestVersion 3`. The
  workspace version is owned by the root `package.json`; do not duplicate a
  frozen version number in docs.

The authoritative structural map is the root `codemap.md` plus per-folder
`codemap.md` files; read those before editing a subsystem.

## Root command surface

All from the repo root unless noted (full list in root `package.json`):

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `pnpm build` | Build every package (`pnpm -r build`) |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Type-check every package |
| `pnpm check` | Per-package `check` (typecheck + build + contract checks) |
| `pnpm test` | Build, then run each package's tests |
| `pnpm dev:desktop` | Run the desktop app in dev |
| `pnpm dev:desktop:control-center` | Dev with renderer/Control Center focus |
| `pnpm dev:desktop:plugins` | Dev with official plugins hot-loaded |
| `pnpm dev:desktop:third-parties` | Dev with direct plugin folders under `third-parties` hot-loaded |
| `pnpm package:desktop` / `:dir` | Build + package the desktop app (full / unpacked dir) |
| `pnpm release:desktop` | macOS-local build, automatic SignPath Windows signing, and verified GitHub publication |
| `pnpm release:npm` | Publish npm packages |
| `pnpm plugins:*` | Plugin test/validate/package/publish/deploy (see below) |

### Plugin DX commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `openpets plugin new <name> --template <t>` | Scaffold an SDK v3 plugin |
| `openpets plugin validate <dir>` | Validate a plugin locally |
| `pnpm plugins:test` | Locale checks + official-plugin harness tests |
| `pnpm plugins:check` | Dry-run the catalog package plan |
| `pnpm plugins:package` | Build catalog + ZIP staging (no upload) |
| `pnpm plugins:validate-release` | Pre-ship release gate |
| `pnpm plugins:publish` | Upload ZIPs to R2 |
| `pnpm plugins:validate-live` | Post-deploy live check |
| `pnpm plugins:deploy` | Deploy the web catalog |

See [Plugin platform](/plugins) for the authoring workflow and
[Testing and validation](/testing-and-validation) for what the validators
catch.

## Running the desktop app

- `pnpm dev:desktop` launches Electron against the TypeScript source with the
  Vite renderer dev server.
- Plugin authors using the installed app do not need this repo: open **Plugins →
  Developer Mode → Load unpacked plugin folder** to validate, snapshot, watch, and
  reload a standalone plugin folder.
- For plugin work, `pnpm dev:desktop:plugins` points the local loader at both
  `plugins/official` and `plugins/dev` (via `OPENPETS_DEV_PLUGIN_ROOTS`) so
  official plugins and in-progress dev plugins hot-load when working on OpenPets
  itself.
- `pnpm dev:desktop:third-parties` loads every direct child of `third-parties`
  that contains `openpets.plugin.json` through `OPENPETS_DEV_PLUGIN_ROOTS`, with
  the plugin catalog disabled. Non-plugin folders are ignored, and changes to a
  discovered plugin's manifest or entry file hot-reload it.
- Logs land in `userData/logs/openpets.log` (path varies by OS). Route renderer
  diagnostics into the app log, not just DevTools (per `AGENTS.md`).

### The CSP footgun

Any renderer-visible URL scheme, image source, dev endpoint, or internal
protocol must be added to the CSP in **both** `apps/desktop/vite.config.ts` and
`apps/desktop/src/renderer/index.html`. Symptom of forgetting: images fall back
to the default pet even though install/render logic is correct. See
[Desktop app](/desktop).

## Logging-as-DX

When working on renderer/IPC/catalog/plugin/pet-window behavior, add **targeted,
scoped** logs as part of the change (data shapes, selected ids, load/error
states, boundary decisions). Avoid noisy permanent logs, secrets, full payload
dumps, or logging inside animation/render loops. The logger
(`apps/desktop/src/logger.ts`) provides scopes and redaction. This is an explicit
repo convention (`AGENTS.md`), not optional polish.

## Release flows

### npm packages

`pnpm release:npm` (`scripts/release-npm.mjs`) orchestrates publishing the
workspace packages. Packages must build and pass `check`/`test` first.

### Desktop app

`pnpm release:desktop -- --yes` (`apps/desktop/scripts/release-local.mjs`) does a
macOS-local build + packaging, creates and pushes the release tag, dispatches
the production SignPath Windows workflow, waits for its signed artifact, and
only then creates a draft GitHub release, verifies its complete asset set, and
publishes it. The local Windows installer is disposable; macOS and Linux
artifacts remain unsigned.

The release runs as checkpointed stages recorded in
`apps/desktop/.release-state/v<version>.json`. If an attempt is interrupted,
re-run the identical command: finished stages are skipped and the release
resumes where it failed, including re-attaching to the SignPath run that was
already dispatched. Inspect the plan with `--status`, force a redo with
`--from <stage>`, and discard the checkpoint with `--reset`. Do not warm up with
`pnpm release:desktop -- --dry-run`; it rebuilds the whole artifact set and
throws it away, and the checkpoint already makes retries cheap. SignPath may
pause for manual approval in its dashboard while the release script visibly
waits.
`electron-builder` handles cross-platform packaging; bundled mode unpacks the
integration CLIs and bundles `plugins/official` as extra resources (verified by
the packaging contract - see [Testing and validation](/testing-and-validation)).

### Web catalog

Pet and plugin catalog deploys run from `web/` with Bun (`bun run deploy`,
`pnpm plugins:deploy`). Catalog generation/verification is in [Catalogs](/catalog)
and the release gates are in [Testing and validation](/testing-and-validation)
and [Release guide](/release).

## Cross-platform & Linux testing

- An **Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64 VMware/Vagrant VM** exists for Linux GUI testing.
  Details and host-side commands are in `AGENTS.md` (VM dir
  `/Volumes/external/vmware/ubuntu24`; guest checkout `/home/vagrant/src/openpets`;
  helpers `cdpets` + `openpets-dx`). Use the **isolated guest clone**, never the
  mounted macOS checkout (platform-specific `node_modules`).
- Use the VM to validate Linux/Wayland renderer, tray, pet-window drag, IPC,
  plugin, and packaging behavior.
- **WSL** cross-platform IPC (WSL client → Windows host over private TCP) is part
  of the protocol - see [IPC and remote control](/ipc).

## Code intelligence

This repo has a **CodeGraph** index (`.codegraph/`) and an MCP server
(`codegraph_*` tools) - a tree-sitter knowledge graph of every symbol/edge/file.
Prefer it for structural questions (who calls X, what breaks if I change Y, where
is Z defined) over grep. Read-only dependency clones for inspecting Electron /
KWin behavior live under `.slim/clonedeps/repos/` (do not edit). Both are
described in `AGENTS.md`.

## Conventions checklist

- Match surrounding code style; keep comment density and naming idiomatic.
- Update the matching `docs/*.md` and `codemap.md` when behavior changes.
- Honor forward-only direction: no legacy compat in current runtime paths.
- Validate at boundaries; atomic writes; reject path traversal/symlinks.
- For plugin/catalog/i18n changes, follow the explicit "update docs / run
  validators" rules in `AGENTS.md`.
